## Goal

Fix incorrect photo and video metadata (especially dates) in files exported from Apple Photos by using accurate metadata from Google Takeout JSON files.

## Folders

- ./old → contains original files exported from Google Takeout, with accompanying .json metadata files
- ./new → contains media files exported from Apple Photos Library ("Unmodified Originals"), some of which have incorrect or missing metadata
- ./archive → contains old library for backup purposes

## Rules

- For each .json file in ./old, extract the "photoTakenTime" field
- Match .json with corresponding media file by filename (e.g. IMG_1234.jpg → IMG_1234.jpg)
- If a match exists in ./new, apply the date metadata from the .json to the file in ./new
- Use exiftool or a similar method to write the metadata fields:
  - DateTimeOriginal
  - CreateDate
  - ModifyDate
- Do not import/export any files manually — just prepare them
- Goal is to have correct metadata in ./new so that it can be imported cleanly into Apple Photos

## Final Step

User will re-import the corrected files from ./new into Apple Photos manually
